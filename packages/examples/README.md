This package contains some example code to use `tanebi` directly in your project. You can use `npx tsx src/(some example).ts` to run the examples.

But first of all, you need to log in by executing `src/login/qrcode.ts` to log in to your QQ account. This will generate credentials under `temp` directory. You can then run the other examples.

All the examples except the QR code login example itself require you to log in first, and use the credentials generated by the QR code login example.
